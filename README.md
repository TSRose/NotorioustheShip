Notorious the Ship
This project is a website for the museum ship, ‘Notorious’, a handcrafted, 15th century, wooden caravel.
The site contains information on the ship’s specifications, maker, history and related imagery, along with options for the user to contact the museum. 
 
UX
Intended to provide a clean, minimalist website with clear navigation, plenty of beautiful photography with small blocks of written information.
 
This website is intended for the following users:
Future museum visitors
Past museum visitors
Traditional media (newspaper/tv/radio)
New media users (bloggers/social media)
People with interests in sailing, wooden ships or general history
User Stories:
As a future museum visitor, I want to find out the museum’s upcoming opening dates & locations, which I find on the home page, and see images and video, so I navigate to the gallery pages.
As a past museum visitor, I want to find out more detailed information about the ship, the story of her build & the general history of caravels, so I navigate to the about sections.
As a traditional media reporter, I want to find some information about the ship, see images and get in touch with the captain, so I navigate to the about, gallery and contact pages.
As a new media user, I want to share photos of and tag the museum on my social media profiles, so I navigate to the about & gallery pages, and follow the museum’s social media links located in the footer.
As a user with a general interest in sailing, wooden ships, and general history, I navigate to the about and gallery pages.

Features Left to Implement
A blog
A current location integrated map
A future appearances calendar
A scrollable animation which shows voyages since launch
 
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
HTML5
The project is written in HTML5.
CSS3
CSS3 is used to style the page.
Bootstrap
The project extensively utilises the Bootstrap library for ease and speed of build.
Code Institue
The project implements parts of the Code Institue Whiskey Drop and Resume Builder walkthroughs as a way to demonstrate and reinforce these lessons.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
