                        <h2>The Ship</h2>
                        <h5>Specs</h5>
                        <p>length: 19.5 metres, beam: 5.5 metres, draught: 2.1 metres, rig: lateen, displacement: 58 tonnes</p>
                        <p>Notorious is constructed entirely of reclaimed timber salvaged from south-west Victoria, Australia. Her keelson is Ironbark, the 
                        ribs and carvel planks are Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) and the trunnels (tree nails) are Australian hardwood. The ship has 
                        a distinctive appearance, coated in "black varnish" the period finish for ships of this era and dressed with lateen sails, a rigging 
                        style taken from the Arab Dhows which gave caravels the amazing ability to sail windward.</p> 
                        <p>Her keel was laid in April 2002 at Bushfield, Victoria and she was launched on 7 February 2011 at Port Fairy, Victoria. Her maiden 
                        voyage was undertaken over three days in January 2012. Setting sail from Martin's Point in Port Fairy (Southern Ocean) Graeme & Felicite
                        along with a crew of friends and family cruised down the Shipwreck Coast, in to Bass Straight, around Cape Otway, then 
                        onward through the heads to Port Philip Bay and finally anchoring in Geelong's Corio Bay. Notorious has since sailed 
                        thousands of nautical miles along the Australian Coast, visiting many ports along the way where she has delighted visitors, young and old.</p>

                        <h2>The Shipbuilder</h2>
                        <p>Graeme Wylie spent two years researching & designing Notorious, and a further eight years constructing her singlehandedly. </p>
                        <p>Graeme can be described as a 'Renaissance Man' as he is an entirely self-taught Nautical Architect, Wooden Shipbuilder and now, Captain. 
                        Notorious is not only an active, sailing ship and museum, she is Felicite & Graeme's home and a beautifully handcrafted work of art, with finely carved sculptures and fittings 
                        found on all decks. Notrious is the living testament to Graeme's vision, passion, tenacity and genius.</p>

                        <h2>The history of <em>caravellas</em></h2>
                        <p>The invention of the caravel is often credited to Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (1394 â€“ 1460), and his fabled navigtion school in Sagres. The
                        first caravels did indeed sail from Lagos on the Algarve Coast in southern Portugal. These small, speedy, manourverable ships were sent on fact-finding missions: 
                        discover and map new lands and find resources to make Portugal wealthy. The caravels were designed with many features which made them perfect ships of exploration: a shallow 
                        draught which allowed them to get close to coastlines and travel up-river, the lateen rig which allowed them to sail a few degrees either side of the wind, 
                        a large hold filled with water, food and other stores required for long voyages, and most importantly caravels were the first ships to have the steerboard moved from the 
                        side of the ship to the stern, inventing the transom and rudder. This era of exploration is now known as "The Age of Discovery", as the Portuguese travelled to almost every corner of the globe 
                        in caravels. Sadly for many Indigenous peoples desctruction followed in the wake of Portuguese (and shortly afterwards, Spanish) exploration as they 
                        spread a deadly trio across the world: disease, gunpowder and Roman Catholicism.</p>
                        <p>Once the early explorers had mapped the new lands and "trade routes" were established, the Portuguese and Spanish developed their naval fleets by building larger ships like the Galleon and the Nau 
                        to plunder the world. And plunder it they did. The Portugese were the first people to establish a slave market on European soil. They did so in Lagos, not coincidentally the birthplace of the caravel
                        and an important Portuguese port city, where people they kidnapped from the West African coast were sold in to slavery. They also returned from the far east with exotic spices, which were worth more than 
                        gold.</p>
                        <p>After about a century of constant use and evolution and the caravels gave way entirely to the new larger vessels. 
                        However, due to their large hold, shallow draught, speed and manouverability, caravels remained a favourite vessel of pirates.</p>
